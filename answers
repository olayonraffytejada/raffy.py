Some of the terms were still new to me, but I liked the option to use Git directly in Windows Explorer because it makes it easy to access and use files. The part I understood best was choosing Notepad as my default editor—it’s simple and easy to work with, which is great for beginners.

Using the shell is fast and direct for running commands. Compared to a program like Thonny, which takes longer to open and navigate, the shell feels quicker and more efficient. It also lets you interact with the computer directly. I remember using it before to install software, though I can’t recall which one.

For example, when I typed cd usr/, the shell showed /usr after using the pwd command.

The file I opened was a Markdown (.md) file. It had three parts: a preview, a code view, and a blame tab. The preview showed my repository name and description. The code view showed the same info as plain text. The blame tab seems to show the history of changes and who made them.
